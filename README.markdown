A simple World of Warcraft combat log splitter. Run it with a combatlog
filename and it'll split on periods of activity. This is currently hard-coded
to 10 minutes - if nothing happens for 10 mins in your raids, you'll get the
log split. Play with the code, it's not exactly complicated.

Use with [LoggerHead][] and [WWS][].
